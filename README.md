This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenge 1

### Replace the Russian Roulette drill code as follows

This component should now track a cat's nine lives.  The cat starts with 9 lives. Relabel the button "Kitty had an accident!"

Each time the button is clicked, you should randomly select a number 1 or 2 (like a coin toss).  If the number is 1, Kitty keeps the same number of lives.  Display the message "Landed on feet! Kitty still has X lives" where X is the current number of lives. If the number is 2, subtract 1 from the number of lives Kitty has and display "Uh oh, used up a life! Kitty has X lives left."  

Don't need to implement this part, but be able to discuss: 

1. How would this implementation need to change if the number of lives was in the parent component's state instead?
2. Can you name an issue that will eventually occur if you click the button lots of times?

## Challenge 2

### Add Links and Routes to the main App component

Create links and routes to navigate to each of the drills
