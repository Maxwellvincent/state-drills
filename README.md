This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenge 1

### Replace the Russian Roulette drill code as follows

This component should now track a cat's nine lives.  The cat starts with 9 lives. Relabel the button "Kitty had an accident!"

Each time the button is clicked, you should randomly select a number 1 or 2 (like a coin toss).  If the number is 1, Kitty keeps the same number of lives.  Display the message "Landed on feet! Kitty still has X lives" where X is the current number of lives. If the number is 2, subtract 1 from the number of lives Kitty has and display "Uh oh, used up a life! Kitty has X lives left."  

Don't need to implement this part, but be able to discuss: 

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
